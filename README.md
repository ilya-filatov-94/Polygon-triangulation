# Polygon triangulation
Drawing with React JS, Canvas, JavaScript  
I came across this synthetic task at one of the competitions in JavaScript programming and I liked it so much that I decided to visualize it using a Canvas.  

## Task
Fill a regular polygon with triangles.  
Triangles must have vertices that coincide with the vertices  
of the polygon and not have common points, including vertices,  
and also filling the largest area of the polygon  
The answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is not more than 1*10e-6
